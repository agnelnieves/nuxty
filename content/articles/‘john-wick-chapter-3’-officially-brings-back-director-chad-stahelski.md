### Whoever comes, whoever it is, John Wick is preparing to kill them all.

A pivotal piece to the success of** *John Wick*** is returning once again. Lionsgate has been bullish on the property as of late. They recently announced the plan to produce a TV pilot for the [series *The Continental*](https://filmschoolrejects.com/john-wick-tv-series-continental-coming-starz/) that would expand the universe much further than its central hero. Now, the studio has secured another part crucial to the *John Wick* series: director **Chad Stahelski** will return to helm **_John Wick: Chapter 3_**.

[Collider confirmed](http://collider.com/john-wick-3-director-chad-stahelski/#images) that Stahelski has signed on for the third installment. After co-directing the first movie and then handling the duties on the sequel by himself, his talents and skills have gone a long way to making *John Wick* what it is today. The report that Collider gained states that principal photography on the film will begin in March and take place in New York City, Spain, and Russia. A casting call has been made for an actress for an unspecified female role while **Hiroyuki Sanada** (_The Wolverine_) will play *Chapter 3*‘s main antagonist.

**Keanu Reeves** will also return for *John Wick: Chapter 3* and the entire world will be after him. The end of *Chapter 2* saw him commit a taboo that would make him unwelcome in The Continental and thus an enemy to all assassins around the world. That might be even too much for “Baba Yaga” to handle. Stahelski has spoken about what he’d like to tackle in *Chapter 3*:

> “We want, not so much to go bigger on the third one, but to show you more of the intricacies of the world… I feel like there are all these different subtleties that I skipped over in number two, that I’d like to go back to on [*Chapter 3*] and show you the inner workings of different parts of New York.”

Stahelski is basically saying don’t expect a highway action sequence to be the spectacle of *John Wick: Chapter 3*. He wants to go smaller, not bigger, with his set pieces.

He is also gearing up to direct the pilot for *The Continental*, thus he has a lot of work on his hands. *John Wick: Chapter 3* is slated for May 17, 2019.
